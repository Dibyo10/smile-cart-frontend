Backend APIs
Given that this is a frontend course focusing on React, we've provided a set of APIs available through https://smile-cart-backend-staging.neetodeployapp.com as the backend. It supports the following endpoints:

List products
To get a list of products, make a GET request to /products. By default, this API returns 10 products. However, you can obtain a maximum of 50 products by including the page_size parameter in the request.

The API supports searching and pagination. To search for a specific product by name, you can use the search_term parameter. For pagination, utilize the page and page_size parameters.

Here is an example with search and pagination parameters: https://smile-cart-backend-staging.neetodeployapp.com/products?search_term=shirt&page=1&page_size=10.

Get product details
To retrieve the details of a specific product by its slug, make a GET request to /products/:slug.

Example: https://smile-cart-backend-staging.neetodeployapp.com/products/infinix-inbook-2.

Place an order
To place a new order, make a POST request to /orders.

The /orders endpoint doesn't enforce data schema validation or data preservation. It simply returns a success status code without further processing.

List countries
To get an array of country objects with their names and codes, make a GET request to /countries.

List states of a country
To get an array of state objects with their names and codes for a selected country, make a GET request to /states with country_code as the request parameter. You can obtain country_code by looking into the response of the /countries API.

For example, to get a list of states of India, make a GET request to https://smile-cart-backend-staging.neetodeployapp.com/states?country_code=IN.
